# Liberty's Villagers

Are you the mayor of a village? Are you tired of your villagers failing to find their beds at nightfall, or forgetting
their workstations in the morning? Have you seen one too many villager die from jumping off stairs and injuring
themselves over and over? Well, Liberty's Villagers is here to help!

Liberty's Villagers is a fabric mod that improves the logic and allows the mayor (you) to modify villager behavior to
provide a better experience for your villagers!

## Features:

### General

* Adjust the range which Villagers will find Points Of Interest (useful for vertical or large cities)
* Adjust how long a Villager will travel to Points of Interest
* Optional - Heal Villagers when they wake up (like Bedrock)
* Optional - Prioritize Villagers avoiding cactus and water
* Optional - Prevent Villagers from climbing up ladders and vines (they don't know how to climb back down, poor dears)
* Adjust the distance Villagers will consider "safe" for jumping down from ledges.
* Optional - Prevent Villagers from breeding (for when you've got a bed that isn't pathable that is causing a population
  boom)
* Optional - Require a free workstation when Villagers decide to have a baby
* Optional - Prevent Villagers from summoning Golems (for when there's a Golem overpopulation problem)
* Optional - Stop Villagers from seeking workstations and meeting points in the middle of the night
* Optional - No nitwit Villagers
* Optional - Every Villager is a Nitwit
* Optional - Every Villager is a Baby
* Optional - Babies never grow up

### Villager Professions

* Optional - Armorers seek out and heal Iron Golems during work hours
* Optional - Clerics seek out and heal Villagers and Players during work hours
* Adjust how far farmers will look for crops in x/z and y planes.
* Optional - Farmers prefer to plant the same type of crop they just harvested

### Golems

* Optional - Golems avoid cactus
* Optional - Golems avoid water
* Optional - Golems don't attack players

### Debug

* Villagerstats command which gives you a summary how how many Villagers are in your town and what their occupations
  are, how many are homeless, and how many open beds are available.
* Villagerinfo command which tells you a summary of a Villager standing before you - where there bed is, where their
  workstation is, where their meeting place is, and what they are holding in their inventory. If looking at a Point of
  Interest (such as a workplace, bed, or bell), it will tell you whether that POI is claimed by a Villager.
* VillagerSetPOI command which lets you toggle whether a block (such as a bed, workplace, or bell) is a valid Point Of
  Interest or not, so you can disable decorative blocks from being considered a workplace, and reserve your own bed to
  sleep in at night.
* Villager Info overlay - for single player and integrated servers, you can see the data from Villagerinfo update as you
  look around, useful for quick debugging during the Villager's meeting times.
